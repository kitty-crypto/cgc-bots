Mae does a lot of things for the Catgirl Coin discord server.
She spawns nekos on command, she checks how many times people say "this is the Mae" and ranks them while also giving the top 3 Mae lovers a special role
She checks if a format for a specific channel is not followed
It also fetches NFT data on request

Recently (2023.08.07) she was updated to utilise slash commands for some of her functions. These are still in testing period and more of the features will be migrated soon
